# Vue Skycons
This was inspired by [Skycons](https://github.com/darkskyapp/skycons) -- a set of ten animated weather glyphs, procedurally generated by JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas tag. They're easy to use, and pretty lightweight, so they shouldn't rain on your parade.

## Installation

```
npm install --save vue-skycons
```

Or

```
yarn add vue-skycons
```

## Usage

```
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueSkycons from 'vue-skycons'

Vue.use(VueSkycons)
```
